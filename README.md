> Crafting your developing journeys with StormText.

# StormText - what is it?
StormText is a free \(as in the abbreviation of *freedom*\) text editor, known as
a freeware. You can use, download, share, contribute and do whatever legal (as in
your country) actions you desire.

StormText is a text and code editor. Notice that there might be struggles for this
application to open binary file \(file stored in terms of binary numerals, namely `0`
and `1`\), which you might experience encoding error or a mess of text if you try to
open them with a normal text editor; so do StormText. If you would like to open those
files, download other hexadecimal file viewers to view: such as Hex, etc.

# Supported platforms
As built with the latest version of Qt 5, StormText supports the following platforms
\(on which you can install directly\):

 * Windows 7 \(both 32-bit and 64-bit systems\)
 * Windows 8.1 \(both 32-bit and 64-bit systems\)
 * Windows 10 21H2 \(both 32-bit and 64-bit systems\)
 * Windows 11 22H2 \(both 32-bit and 64-bit systems\)

## Other supported platforms
If you don't recognize one of the platform on the list above, see if the following
matches.
 * GNU/Linux openSUSE 15.4 or later, 64-bit systems only
 * GNU/Linux SUSE Linux Enterprise Server \(any version\), 64-bit systems only
 * GNU/Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 or later, 64-bit systems only
 * GNU/Linux Ubuntu 18.04 or later, 64-bit systems only
 * GNU/Linux \(any distributions or versions, both 32-bit and 64-bit systems\), while the GCC 5 or later must be preset.
 * macOS 10.13 or later, 64-bit systems only; or Apple M1/M2 chips only

If you don't see your platform on the above two lists; we appologize that we are afraid you
cannot use StormText on your computer as Qt doesn't support them.

If you don't see your platform on the first list but on the second list, you might need
to build from source. Make sure that you install the `QScintilla` framework as well after
installing Qt.

If you don't see your platform on the second list but on the first list, congratulation!
You don't need to install the whole Qt framework again but use directly the executable
that we provided on GitHub releases. Just download and follow the instructions to install
the application, similar to what you will do with other applications that you have installed
them before.
